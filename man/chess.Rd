\title{Chess playing dataset}
\description{
A tally of wins and losses for games between three chess players:
Topalov, Anand, Karpov
}
\usage{data(chess)}
\details{

  This is a very simple dataset that can be used for illustration of
  \code{hyper2} idiom.
  
  The players are:
  \itemize{
    \item Grandmaster Veselin Topalov.  \acronym{FIDE} world
    champion 2005-2006; peak rating 2813
    \item Grandmaster Viswanathan Anand.  \acronym{FIDE} world
    champion 2000-2002, 2008; peak rating 2799
    \item Grandmaster Anatoly Karpov.  \acronym{FIDE} world
    champion 1993-1999; peak rating 2780
  }

  Observe that Topalov beats Anand, Anand beats Karpov, and Karpov beats
  Topalov (where \dQuote{beats} means \dQuote{wins more games than}).

  The games thus resemble a noisy version of \dQuote{rock paper scissors}.

  The likelihood function does not record who played white; see
  \code{karpov_kasparov_anand} for such a dataset.

These objects can be generated by running script
\code{inst/rock_paper_scissors.Rmd}, which includes some further
discussion and technical documentation and creates file \code{chess.rda}
which resides in the \code{data/} directory.
