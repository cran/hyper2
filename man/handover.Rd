\title{Dataset on communication breakdown in handover between physicians}
\description{

  Object \code{handover} is a likelihood function corresponding to a
  dataset arising from 69 medical malpractice claims and concerns
  handover (or hand-off) between physicians.  This dataset was analysed
  by Lin et al. (2009), and further analysed by Altham and Hankin
  (2010).  The computational methods are presented in the (unmaintained)
  \pkg{hyperdirichlet} and \pkg{aylmer} packages and a further
  discussion is given in the \dQuote{integration} vignette of the
  \pkg{hyper2} package.  The original dataset is \code{handover_table},
  a three-by-three matrix of counts.

\details{
These objects can be generated by running script
\code{inst/handover.Rmd}, which includes some further discussion and
technical documentation, and creates file \code{handover.rda} which
resides in the \code{data/} directory.
